SEIKO SBDC001, AKA SUMO
The third Seiko I bought was a second hand watch from Seikoholism FB site. 
Back in 2017 I did not knew much about this model yeat but I think I gotlucky to get the first gen SCUBA SUMO.

Later I realised the previous seller changed the bezel insert. 
I felt lucky again. I finalized the watch by adding a cyclop glass over the date and voilà it was perfect. A true keeper.
