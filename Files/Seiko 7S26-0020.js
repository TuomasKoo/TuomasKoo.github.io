SEIKO Automatic Diver, 7S26-0020, AKA SKX007 
2017 was the year when I really got into watches. I basically had only few quartz watches before this and those did not actually lit my watch enthusiasm. 

Once my friend winked about the Seikoholism facebook page (Seikoholisti) and I saw all the cool Seikos I was sold. I had to buy my first mechanical watch and of course it was cool as hell SKX007. After this watches have turned into full a time hobby.
